General Wireshark Working Methodology

I have been using wireshark for a long time, very long time to be honest but I have seen that there are various types of methodologies that people use. 

This is my personal methodology and I seem to enjoy this more than other things, I generally change the methodology according to the need of the capture. 
This is the basic methodology that I generally use. 

Firstly, I prefer to ping the website (I prefer the terminal)

Then I choose the interface, for example in this instance eth0 or eth1. 

After that, I generally use a preferred browser firefox and then I open the related website. 

After that, we can see the packets over there.

We have seen that, sometimes the webpage is http or https, regarding these topics we can see that HTTP has no encryption and we can read the vulnerable data openly.

As for HTTPS,we have seen that HTTPS has great encryption and can we decrypt the methodologies? 

We dont know for sure, keep on reading for the various kinds of things we can learn.
